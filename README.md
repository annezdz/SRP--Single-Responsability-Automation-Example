# SRP Single Responsability Automation Example

### Single Responsibility Principle: 

Each and every module, class, method in an application should have only one specific responsibility to handle. 
Using this we could refactor our complex Pages Objects into multiple modular Page Components or Page Fragments and we could write very neat test steps.
